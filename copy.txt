Blue Period

1901 - 1904

During which Picasso would paint works of blue and blue-green shades to give off a sad feeling. Beggars and prostitutes were the usual focal point of these works. Picasso was inspired to do this by a trip he made through Spain and by the suicide of his friend Carlos Casagemas.

Rose Period

1901 - 1906

Consists of more cheery works of art (makes a change from prostitutes) with brighter colors. I presume he ran out of blue and green and had to use something else. These bright pieces featured many circus people

Cubism Period

1909 - 1912

Analytic cubism (1909–1912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges Braque using monochrome brownish and neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and "analyzed" them in terms of their shapes.

“If I don't have red, I use blue”

“Colours, like features, follow the changes of the emotions”

“It took me four years to paint like Raphael,
but a lifetime to paint like a child”
